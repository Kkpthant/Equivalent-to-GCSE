# Equivalent-to-GCSE
I have done qualification equivalent to GCSE outside UK. 
The exam is known as Matriculation Exam and I had passed with distinctions in Maths, Chemistry, and Physics, and merit in English. 
Furthermore, I have also achieved a BA (honors) degree in Archaeology, MA degree in Archaeology, and a postgraduate degree in Chineses, Indian, and Southeast Asian arts.
